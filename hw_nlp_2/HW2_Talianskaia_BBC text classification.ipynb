    "Here I used tdidf approach, instead of 'bag of words' to define the most 'typical' words and phrases for each class and then applied different classifiers to find the best one. Most of applied classifiers performed quite well (with F1-score 0.96+), performing a little bit worse on 'smaller' classes, that might be an issue of some small sample imbalance.\n",
    "After chosing and tuning several models with cross-validation, I reach the result of F1-score = 0.98+, the best models turned to be Multi-Layer Perception with default settings, LogRegression with C=100 and penalty=l2 and Linear SVC with C=1 and multi_calss=ovr. Possibly, the cross-validation with more than k=5 will show even better results. Nevertheless, all obtained classifier perform pretty good.\n",
    "The choice of metric is based on the fact that 'F1-score' is rather balanced one compared to precision and recall metrics, which, as we can see, vary from one class to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note1:the model tuning is self-plagiarism from the first task and possible coincidences with groupmates are really accidental.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note2: after downloading to github I noticed that some errors during running all the file may occure due to some problems with the last libraries updates (there are o lot of similar cases globally with numoy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), but it used to run ok earlier. Unfortunately, it can't be fixed by my forces.*"
